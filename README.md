Visual Basic Example for creating a Discord Bot using [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) (2.2.1)

## Getting Started 
### Documentation  
Before you start coding a project, I would suggest reviewing the [Guides](https://discord.foxbot.me/latest/guides/getting_started/installing.html) and [Documentation](https://discord.foxbot.me/latest/api/index.html) provided.  
### Initial Visual Studio Project
Once you've created your new project (preferably a .Net Core Console Application) install the following  
Nuget Packages:  
- [Discord.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discord.Net/) 
- [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json/)  

From there, simply follow one of the provided example templates, to get your bot connected. Each example includes a command module implementation to help you get started with commands.
